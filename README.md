# Som TTS dataset: Open Data Thai TTS (v1.0.0)

Som TTS dataset is a Open Data Thai TTS. It was created by open-weight TTS model that support Thai and use voice clone that voice was created by voice design system.

This repository collects scripts for creating Thai TTS dataset.

TTS Model that use this dataset: [https://github.com/awslabs/FastThaiG2P](https://github.com/awslabs/FastThaiG2P)


## Steps to creating dataset:

1. We was doing the voice design to creating new voice that don't exist. See voice-design.ipynb
2. Cleaning text from many sources. See n0-clean-text.ipynb
3. Make voice dataset by using voice cloning to creating dataset. See n1-make-voice.py
4. Filter dataset. See n2-filter_dataset.py, n3-filter2-and-count.py and n4-clean-text.ipynb.
5. Upload to HuggingFace dataset. See up2hub.ipynb


We use OmniVoice weight that still be Apache license 2.0 to creating this dataset. [https://huggingface.co/wannaphong/OmniVoice](https://huggingface.co/wannaphong/OmniVoice)


**Don't forget clearing by ASR model before use the dataset***
